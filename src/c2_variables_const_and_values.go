@description: In this poackage I learned how to create variables and consts.
Now, I know that every variable has a type, that can be useed to represent differents
things, like numbers with decimal points, strings or numbers without decimal points.

package main

func main() {
	// define consts
	const pi float32 = 3.14
	const pi2 = 3.14

	// definne interger
	number_no_defined := 1
	var number int16 = 1
	var other_number int
}
